# Brazilian E-Commerce Dashboard Report

## Overview
This repository contains an interactive dashboard for analyzing the Brazilian e-commerce dataset provided by Olist. The dashboard aims to provide key insights into the sales performance, customer distribution, and product category trends on the platform. It serves as a tool for stakeholders to make data-driven decisions and improve their understanding of the e-commerce landscape.
## Objective
The objective of this study is to undertake a personal project focused on SQL (BigQuery) to clean and query the dataset, utilizing subqueries and data relationships. Additionally, the data will be visualized using Google Data Studio to create an interactive and insightful dashboard.
## Dataset Description
The dataset used for this challenge was sourced from Kaggle. It contains detailed information on 100,000 orders placed between 2016 and 2018 across various marketplaces in Brazil. The dataset's features allow for a comprehensive view of each order from multiple dimensions, including order status, price, payment, and freight performance, customer location, product attributes, and customer reviews. Additionally, the dataset includes a geolocation dataset that links Brazilian zip codes to latitude and longitude coordinates.
