# Music Industry Analysis for Conduct Music Festival 

## Tools
* MsSQL Server
* Microsoft Power BI
## Introduction
In this project, I conducted a comprehensive analysis of a music dataset to assist in organizing an optimal music festival. The analysis focused on identifying the best location, selecting performing artists, determining the ideal timing, and suggesting a theme based on data-driven insights.
## Objective
This project aims to enhance my data analytics skills by analyzing a music dataset. It focuses on identifying the best artist, location, and date for a music festival. By applying data analysis techniques and using analytical tools like SQL and Power BI, I aim to gain practical experience in data-driven decision-making for real-world applications.
## Dataset Description
[The dataset](https://github.com/Watcharapollll/Data-Anlyst-Portfolio/blob/main/Music%20Industry%20Analysis/music%20store%20data.zip) used for this analysis includes information on music tracks, albums, artists, genres, invoices, and customer transactions. It was stored and managed using Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio for data querying and preparation.
## Business Questions
- Where will the music festival take place?
- Who will perform on stage?
- When should the festival occur?
- What should be the theme of the music festival?
